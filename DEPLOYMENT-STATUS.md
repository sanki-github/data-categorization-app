# 🎉 Deployment Complete! 

## ✅ Live Application URLs

### Frontend (React SPA)
**🌐 Live URL**: http://data-categorization-frontend-sitebucket-syud6yzxdn7w.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com

- **Status**: ✅ **LIVE and Working**
- **Technology**: React + Vite, deployed to AWS S3 static website
- **Features**: Health check, responsive design, shows app description
- **API Configuration**: Configured to call backend (though backend has deployment issues)

### Backend API
**🌐 Target URL**: http://Bdca-app-env.eba-z7q9arqh.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

- **Status**: ⚠️ **Deployment Issues** (Elastic Beanstalk container configuration)
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express + SQLite, deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **Issue**: Docker configuration conflicts in EB (Dockerrun.aws.json version mismatch)
- **Alternative**: GitHub Actions workflow ready for App Runner deployment

## 📊 Infrastructure Deployed

### ✅ Successfully Deployed
1. **S3 Static Website** - Hosting the React frontend
2. **CloudFormation Stack** - Infrastructure as Code for S3 bucket
3. **ECR Repository** - Ready for backend Docker images
4. **Elastic Beanstalk Application** - Created with source bundles uploaded

### 🚧 Partially Deployed  
1. **Elastic Beanstalk Environment** - Application versions uploaded but container startup issues
2. **CI/CD Workflows** - GitHub Actions ready but requires secrets configuration

## 🛠️ Working Features

### Frontend ✅
- Modern React SPA with Vite build system
- Responsive UI with clean design
- Environment-aware API configuration
- Deployed with proper S3 website hosting
- CloudFormation-managed infrastructure

### Backend 🔄
- Complete Node.js application with all features:
  - User authentication (register/login/reset)
  - Item management with categories  
  - Bulk CSV/XLSX upload processing
  - Role-based access control
  - Background worker for file processing
  - SQLite database with migrations
- Application code is working (tested locally)
- Docker container configuration needs adjustment for EB

## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Full Deployment

### Option 1: Fix Elastic Beanstalk (Recommended for quick fix)
1. **Analyze EB logs**: Download eb-engine.log to see Docker startup issues
2. **Fix Dockerfile**: Ensure proper port binding and startup command
3. **Create Dockerrun.aws.json**: Use version 1 for single container
4. **Redeploy**: Create new application version with fixes

### Option 2: Use App Runner (Recommended for production)
1. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_REGION` (us-west-2)
2. **Trigger Workflow**: Push to main branch or manually run "Deploy Backend to App Runner"
3. **Get URL**: Workflow outputs the App Runner service URL
4. **Update Frontend**: Set VITE_API_BASE to App Runner URL and redeploy

### Option 3: Use GitHub Codespaces/CloudShell (Manual)
1. **Build Docker image** in environment with Docker available
2. **Push to ECR**: Use existing repository `data-categorization-backend`
3. **Create App Runner service**: Point to ECR image
4. **Update frontend** with new backend URL

## 💰 Current AWS Costs

### Active Resources
- **S3 Static Website**: ~$0.50/month (minimal usage)
- **ECR Repository**: Free for 500MB storage
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: ~$15-20/month (t3.micro instance running)

### Estimated Total: ~$15-21/month

### Cost Optimization
- **App Runner**: Pay-per-use, ~$5-10/month for low traffic
- **Lambda + API Gateway**: Serverless option, ~$1-5/month for low traffic
- **Stop EB environment**: Terminate to stop charges, redeploy when ready
